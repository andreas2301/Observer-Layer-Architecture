## 📖 About

The **Observer Layer Architecture (OLA)** is a framework-agnostic architectural design that extends the standard Orchestrator-Agent Swarm model (e.g., Microsoft MARA) by introducing a mandatory third tier: the **Sentinel Governance Layer** (Tier 0).

By strictly decoupling resource provisioning from identity management, OLA creates a "Double-Blind" privacy model that guarantees data sovereignty. It ensures that no single compromised tier—not even the core orchestrator—can both orchestrate processes and access plaintext secrets.

## 🚀 Why This Matters Right Now

As autonomous agents become deeply integrated into enterprise systems:

1. **The Orchestrator is a Single Point of Failure:** In standard 2-tier setups, the "God-process" orchestrator holds both compute and credential keys. If it falls, the entire system is breached.
2. **Untrusted Tool Ecosystems:** Agents rely on Model Context Protocols (MCPs) and marketplace skills. Vetting these in real-time is impossible.
3. **Overwhelmed Humans:** Binary "allow/deny" guardrails either fail to stop novel threats or spam human operators with false positives.

**OLA solves this by introducing a *Graduated Governance Pipeline* and enforcing *Architectural Distrust*.**

## 🏗️ Core Concepts

* **Tier 0: Sentinel Governance (The Observer):** An isolated layer housing the Secret Manager, Rule Engine, and an Immutable Audit Log. It holds the keys, but has no compute execution power.
* **Tier 1: The Orchestrator:** Manages agent lifecycles and routes external traffic, but is physically blinded from plaintext credentials.
* **Tier 2: The Agent Swarm:** The operational environment where domains specialize and execute tasks, authenticated directly against Tier 0 via mTLS.
* **The Lockbox Protocol:** A resilient safe-fail mechanism replacing "delete-on-breach" triggers. It encrypts a compromised agent's runtime state for forensic review without exposing data to the attacker.
